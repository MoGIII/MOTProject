# MOTProject
Multiple Object Tracking Project written in Python as a Final Project for a course.


Programming Language: Python
Libraries used: OpenCV, math, date, 

The main function of the project is to track a specific person or all people in a video, and determine if the social distancing standards are preserved.
The project mainly utilizes learned aspects of Image Processing and Computer Vision techniques - Gaussian filter, Canny Edge detection, MIL and CSRT trackers - all combined in order to allow our program to track multiple objects simultaneously.

The project was created Maxim Gromov and Aaron Leviashvili.
